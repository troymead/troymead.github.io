                <p id="position-desc">During my second co-op rotation with GE Aviation I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of the Full Authority Digital Engine 
                    Control (FADEC) System for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.geaviation.com/commercial/engines/ge9x-commercial-aircraft-engine">GE9X commercial engine</a> through 
                    the GE9X Software team. While on this team, the majority of my work consisted of helping the team get through tool qualification and required engine certification. 
                    My contribution to the tool qualification effort consisted of reviewing results from tests cases of a few Python tools the team used, and making sure that the reuslts matched 
                    what was described in the requirements. I also conducted 5 test case reviews on new function implementations to aid in the formal software testing process, which was used as a part 
                    of the overall engine Part 33 certification. During the rotation I learned more about requirements software such as IBM Rational DOORS and Rational Change. This experience allowed me to
                    learn more about the test-driven development process.

                <p id="position-desc">My first co-op rotation was with GE Aviation in Grand Rapids, Michigan under the Aviation Systems division. During this rotation, I contributed to the 
                    <a target ="_blank" href="https://www.geaviation.com/press-release/systems/ge-aviation-and-auterion-team-provide-all-one-hardware-and-software-platform">Civil Unmanned Air Systems</a> program through
                    developing tools using Python which aided in vehicle configuration. While I was there, my team focused on integrating a drone autopilot software called PX4 into different flying vehicle configurations, one including quadcopters. 
                    The first Python tool I developed took data from test flight logs and printed plots based on this data to PDFs. The purpose of this tool was to make the post-flight data processing step more efficient to the team. Before the development
                    of the tool, the team spent unnecessary time extracting extensive data into CSV files, then creating charts that were necessary for review. 
                    The second tool I developed helped the team calibrate the gyroscope sensors used on each vehicle developed. This consisted of extracting data from gyroscope sensor tests then comparing the test results to the expected values and generating 
                    compensation values based on the difference.

                <p id="position-desc">Beyond the technical skills I learned, I also had the opportunity to contribute to a project that followed the Agile methodology for software development. During my time, I participated in my team's daily standup meetings, 
                    contributed to sprint planning, and held code reviews for the team in order to produce a product that would satisfy all parties.

                and current knowledge, I would like to explore more opportunities for data analysis. Outside of my work experience, I have also taken some time to learn more on my own, for example learning JavaScript to possibly pursue web development opportunities. These are the 
                two areas I am most interested in taking my career at the moment.

            <p id="position-desc">I feel that pursuing a computer science degree at UC has greatly helped me develop my technical and interpersonal skills, 
                work for a great company that makes an impact, and create genuine connections with people who have a passion for engineering as a whole. 
                I have encountered work that I enjoyed doing, as well as some projects that were not as exciting to complete. Through these experiences, I have 
                learned that there will always be things in your career that you like to do and have the opprtunity to do so, but there will also be assignments 
                and tasks that must be completed even though they might not be as interesting.
            </p>
            <p id="position-desc">As I focus on completing my remaining two years here, I plan to focus on seeking out different job and learning opportunities to eventually find 
                a path that interests me the most, ultimately leading me to make a decision on what I would like to pursue post-graduation. I hope to do this through programs and organizations
                 I am currently a part of (MLT, NSBE) that allow me to develop myself academically and professionally.
