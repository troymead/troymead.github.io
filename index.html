                for the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) on campus where I have the opportunity to mentor, serve the community, and make advancements in my academic and professional career.

                <p id="date">Aug 2019 - Dec 2019</p>
                <p id="position-desc">During my second co-op rotation with GE Aviation I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of the Full Authority Digital Engine 
                    Control (FADEC) System for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.geaviation.com/commercial/engines/ge9x-commercial-aircraft-engine">GE9X commercial engine</a> through 
                    the GE9X Software team. While on this team, the majority of my work consisted of helping the team get through tool qualification and required engine certification. 
                    My contribution to the tool qualification effort consisted of reviewing results from tests cases of a few Python tools the team used, and making sure that the reuslts matched 
                    what was described in the requirements. I also conducted 5 test case reviews on new function implementations to aid in the formal software testing process, which was used as a part 
                    of the overall engine Part 33 certification. During the rotation I learned more about requirements software such as IBM Rational DOORS and Rational Change.

                <p id="date">Jan 2019 - May 2019</p>
                <p id="position-desc">My first co-op rotation was with GE Aviation in Grand Rapids, Michigan under the Aviation Systems division. During this rotation, I contributed to the 
                    <a target ="_blank" href="https://www.geaviation.com/press-release/systems/ge-aviation-and-auterion-team-provide-all-one-hardware-and-software-platform">Civil Unmanned Air Systems</a> program through
                    developing tools using Python which aided in vehicle configuration. While I was there, my team focused on integrating a drone autopilot software called PX4 into different flying vehicle configurations, one including quadcopters. 
                    The first Python tool I developed took data from test flight logs and printed plots based on this data to PDFs. The purpose of this tool was to make the post-flight data processing step more efficient to the team. Before the development
                    of the tool, the team spent unnecessary time extracting extensive data into CSV files, then creating charts that were necessary for review. 
                    The second tool I developed helped the team calibrate the gyroscope sensors used on each vehicle developed. This consisted of extracting data from gyroscope sensor tests then comparing the test results to the expected values and generating 
                    compensation values based on the difference.

            <p id="position-desc">Besides learning new languages and their capabilities, I have a passion for photography. Since I was 13 years old, I have made an effort 
                to express myself through my photography, usually through portraits of my friends and family. Recently, I've taken the initiative to document 
                moments at events put together by my school's NSBE chapter. Feel free to browse some of my work!
